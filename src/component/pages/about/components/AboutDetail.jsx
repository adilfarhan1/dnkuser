                DNK is the harmony, dream and friendship between Dann Leslie and
                Waseem Khursheed who placed their trust and confidence in each
                other and believed in each other to make a tangible difference
                in people's lives, in their communities, and this ambitious
                commitment and burning passion endured them through life's
                challenges and helped them emerge as successful. Hence, they
                understand the importance of trust, confidence, and commitment
                extremely well.

                Conscience at heart. Everything, at DNK, revolves around and is
                rooted in 'conscience'. It's not a mere slogan we frivolously
                use but strive to live every day. It is our moral compass and a
                guiding light towards creating a local and global community of
                conscientious leaders of tomorrow. It dictates us to be honest,
                transparent, and straightforward in our dealings, and businesses
                and we religiously follow to that end every single time. Our
                company culture is heavily drawn from the innate values of the
                friendship between our founders forged on trust, confidence, and
                commitment and are imbibed in our practices.

                We are constantly striving to set new standards and avoid
                falling into complacency. This relentless obsession for
                greatness drives us forward to seek and adopt new, fresh and
                innovative ideas. Life has taught us the best ideas come from
                the humblest and simplest experiences. We aim to deliver honest
                service to our clients, with our professionals empowered to
